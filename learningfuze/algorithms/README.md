# Algorithms & Data Structures

## Detailed Breakdown

### 1. Big O Notation
- What is Big O?
- Analyzing time and space complexity

#### Step-by-Step Exercise: Complexity Practice
1. Write a function that sums all numbers in an array. What is its time complexity?
2. Write a function that checks if a number is prime. Analyze its complexity.

### 2. Sorting and Searching
- Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort
- Linear and binary search

#### Step-by-Step Exercise: Sorting
1. Implement bubble sort on an array of numbers.
2. Implement binary search on a sorted array.

### 3. Recursion
- What is recursion?
- Base case and recursive case

#### Step-by-Step Exercise: Recursive Function
1. Write a recursive function to calculate factorial.
2. Write a recursive function to reverse a string.

### 4. Data Structures
- Arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, hash tables

#### Step-by-Step Exercise: Stack Implementation
1. Implement a stack using an array or class.
2. Write push and pop methods.

### 5. Coding Challenges
- Practice with LeetCode, Codewars, or similar

### 6. Mini-Project: Algorithm Practice Set
Create a set of algorithm problems and solve them. Document your solutions and approaches.
