# Mini-Project: Chat App

Build a basic chat application where users can:
- Enter a username and join a chat room
- Send and receive messages in real time (simulate with setInterval or use a simple backend if desired)
- Display timestamps for each message

Stretch goals:
- Support multiple chat rooms
- Add emojis or file sharing
- Persist chat history
