# Mini-Project: E-Commerce Cart

Build a simple e-commerce shopping cart where users can:
- View a list of products (name, price, image)
- Add products to the cart
- View cart contents and total price
- Remove items from the cart

Stretch goals:
- Persist cart with localStorage
- Add product filtering/search
- Checkout form with validation
