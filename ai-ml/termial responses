As of late 2025, the most sought-after tech stacks for web and app development are:

MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)
Next.js (React framework) with TypeScript
JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs, Markup) using frameworks like Gatsby or Next.js
Python with Django or FastAPI (for backend)
Serverless architectures (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
Mobile: React Native or Flutter
For enterprise: .NET Core with C#, or Java Spring Boot
MERN and Next.js/TypeScript are especially popular for fullstack web development jobs and freelancing.
